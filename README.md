# FamilyFun
This is a fun project I have taken upon myself to create a fun web app for my kids to go on and enter good deeds they have done. When they enter a task/good deed, a fun "great job" page is displayed.

For this project, I have taken inspiration from Uncle Bob (Robert Martin) and left the perstancy layer out of the code. I will add it as it becomes necesary. For the single area that persistance was required thus far, I have serialzed the data to Json and peristsed to a the local file system.
