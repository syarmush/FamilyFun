# FamilyFun
This is a fun project I have taken upon myself to create a fun web app for my kids to go on and enter good deeds they have done. When they enter a task/good deed, a fun "great job" page is displayed.

For this project, I have taken inspiration from Uncle Bob (Robert Martin) and left the persistence layer out of the code. I will add persistence as it becomes necessary. For the single area that persistence was required thus far, I have serialized the data to Json and persisted it to the local file system.
